# Sundial — Progress Log

## 2026-07-21 — Budget calculator: deployment & integration (parallel build)

Integrated the verified budget calculation engine (`budget-lambda.zip`) into the repo
and built the surrounding wiring. Design unchanged — deployment/integration only.

**Lambda (`lambdas/sundial-budget/`)**
- Placed the package under our `lambdas/<name>/` convention (spec said `lambda/budget/`).
- `npm install` + `npm test` → **32/32** field checks against the HOLLAND workbook. `budgetCalc.js` untouched.
- Rewrote `handler.js` to ESM using `lib/salesforce.js` (org-standard JWT bearer flow); **dropped jsforce**. Reads via `sfQuery`, writeback via a new shared `lib/salesforce.js » sfUpdateRecord`.
- Template: kept `template/budget-template.xlsx` as source of record; `prebuild.mjs` base64-embeds it into the bundle at deploy time, `postbuild.mjs` cleans up; `deploy.ps1` gained generic pre/post-build hooks. Tests read the source `.xlsx`, so tested == shipped bytes.
- Bundle validated via esbuild (3.6 MB after dropping jsforce; 4.5 MB with the added libs).

**Task 2 — recalc endpoint:** handler HTTP path now verifies the Supabase JWT (`resolveIdentity`) and tenant-scopes the record read; documented `POST /projects/{recordId}/budget/recalc` in `docs/api-endpoints.md`; gateway wiring delivered as `scripts/wire-budget-recalc-route.ps1` (not yet run against prod).

**Task 4 — file metadata:** added best-effort `lib/file-access.js » registerFileMetadata`; handler registers each snapshot (category "Budget") in Supabase. Flagged: the deployed Files tab lists from S3, so the snapshot already appears; this aligns with the documented Supabase-backed design.

**Task 3 — triggers:** drafted the after-save Flow `salesforce/flows/Sundial_Budget_Recalc_Trigger.flow-meta.xml` (loop guard on `Budget_Last_Calculated__c`; entry split into two sub-3900-char formulas since 73 `ISCHANGED` terms exceed the formula limit) + `docs/integrations/budget-recalc-relay.md`.

**Task 5 — Acumatica ProjectBudget:** built read + reconcile scaffolding only (`lambdas/sundial-acumatica-budget-push/`, `lib/acumatica.js » getAcumaticaEntity`). **Write path hard-guarded off** — the mapping tab has no `InventoryID` column (match key not unique) and the income code is `BILL` (unconfirmed vs `BALANCE`/`GENM`). Documented in `docs/integrations/acumatica-budget-push.md`.

**Housekeeping:** moved `budget-lambda.zip` + `sundial-budget-deploy.zip` into git-tracked `artifacts/`; added `exceljs` to root deps.

**Pending:** AWS function `sundial-budget` creation (Tim) → deploy → Gate 2 smoke test; prod API Gateway route deploy; relay wiring; the blocked-on-Harmon items in TASKS.md.
